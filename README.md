This code analyzes the frequency content of a simple sine wave using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

## Functionality

- Imports necessary libraries: NumPy and Matplotlib.
- Defines the sampling rate, time vector, and signal frequency.
- Generates a sine wave signal with the specified frequency.
- Calculates the FFT of the signal.
- Extracts the frequency components from the FFT result.
- Plots the original signal in the time domain and the frequency spectrum.

## Technologies Used

- Python
